# algebraic-graphs-io

This package aims to collect some I/Outilities for `algebraic-graphs`, e.g. parsers and serializers for common graph data interchange formats.

Currently it provides a parser for the GML format, which is used by a few common graph software packages (NetworkX, Gephi, graphviz, and others).

PRs and contributions welcome!
