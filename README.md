# algebraic-graphs-io

This package aims to collect some I/O utilities for `algebraic-graphs`, e.g. parsers and serializers for common graph data interchange formats.

Currently it provides parsers for the following formats :

* GML : used by a few common graph software packages (NetworkX, Gephi, graphviz, and others)

* .tsv : tab-separated list of edge data, used e.g. for the Graph Challenge dataset : https://graphchallenge.mit.edu/data-sets


There are also pre-parsed example datasets ready for consumption in `Algebra.Graph.IO.Datasets`
